# Dijkstra Path Finding

Dijkstra path finding algorithm implemented in MATLAB. It is tested on the graphs generated by the procedure specified in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/30918).

The code also plots the distribution of shortest paths for given graphs, some descriptive statistics, and shows the runtime for graphs of varying sizes.

Run `main.m` to produce the above described results.
